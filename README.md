This project has two main utilities. The first of which is a blog generator which allows you to save and share AI generated blogs about a specific Youtube video (after creating an account).
The second utility is a timestamp generator for Youtube videos with links to the specific time they represent.
In order to run the code on your machine, you must create a keys.py file in directories where api calls are made, and set the needed key variables.
This repository was inspired by an ai blog generatorproject by freecodecamp, which I built on top of and added many functionalities (ts generation, ability to save, share and delete posts, ability to handle much longer videos, etc), as well as improved the general speed by reducing API calls.
